I get asked fairly often about resources to learn about Industrial Control Systems Security.

A couple months back I started compiling some of the resources that I have used. Then I asked some friends for input and linked to some other really good lists.  

Garrett Guinivan added resources, I parsed links and notes posted by Isiah Jones and included links to Robert M. Lee and Dragos, Inc. curated reading lists. There is some overlap and that typically means those are the gems. 

This is by no means exhaustive and I believe it will be a long term work in progress.

If you have stuff to add please message me and I will take a look, together we are stronger.

This is my first Git Repo, so any help or recommendations would be appreciated...
